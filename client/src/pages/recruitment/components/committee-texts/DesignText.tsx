				As a designer, you will be responsible for designing our website pages,
				logos, assets, and social media graphics to represent our organization
				and events. Designers also shape the theme and aesthetic for ZotHacks
				and IrvineHacks. Each design will follow general guidelines and have to
				be submitted for review before the given deadlines. You must be
				detail-oriented and have proficient knowledge of design principles,
				color theory, and typography. You will also be working closely with the
				web development team, so experience with HTML and CSS is a plus, but not
				required. Strong collaboration skills are also essential, as you will
				work with other members to contribute to club events.
